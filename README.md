Hello! I'm Riddhisha. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Masters student in the Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan. My github is primarily an attempt to hone my AIML related skills. 

My latest project utilizes scenario based qualitative stress testing to identify US coastal census tracts expected to adversely impacted by sea level rise in the medium (2050) and long term (2100). You can see a snippet of it below and explore more details [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-coastal-residential-real-estate-assets-f3d7764cbe8f) or [here](https://github.com/prarid/SeaLevelRiseImpact_CoastalRealEstate). I hope you will find it interesting!

I am also a CFA charterholder and have extensive experience in financial services predominately for credit portfolios. Currently, I am an Executive Director at Morgan Stanley and serve as the Global Program Manager for Generative AI (OpenAI GPT, Copilot, etc.) adoption in financial risk modeling. My prior experience is with Ernst&Young (EY) where I worked in financial risk model governance and large scale regulatory change roll-outs (DoddFrank, CCAR, CECL, FRTB).

I would love to connect with you to discuss ideas in the GenAI/AIML space! Please reach out to me via LinkedIn.
