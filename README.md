Hello! I'm Riddhisha. ðŸ‘‹

I am a Masters student in the Applied Data Science program at the University of Michigan. My github is primarily an attempt to hone my AIML related skills. 

I am a CFA charterholder and my professional experience is in financial services. I have worked predominantly in model governance and control related functions for credit risk stress loss modeling, counterparty ratings (scorecard) modeling, and technical documenation. I also have extensive experience on quant support roles related to large scale regulatory change roll-outs (CCAR, CECL, FRTB). Please check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/riddhishaprabhu/) for more on my professional experience.

My latest project utilizes scenario based qualitative stress testing to identify US coastal census tracts expected to adversely impacted by sea level rise in the medium (2050) and long term (2100). You can see a snippet of it below and explore more details [here](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/impact-of-rising-sea-levels-on-coastal-residential-real-estate-assets-f3d7764cbe8f) or [here](https://github.com/prarid/SeaLevelRiseImpact_CoastalRealEstate). I hope you will find it interesting!
